                <h3><img src="assets/images/ganesha.jpeg" class="img-circle media-object" height=100 width=100>Lord Ganesha is the eldest son of Lord Shiva and Parvati. Parvati using her powers, created Ganesh from Sandalwood, turmeric, and from the flesh of her own body. She gave him life by sprinkling holy Ganges water over him, and was overjoyed with her new companion. After some time, Parvati wanted to take a bath, and asked Ganesh to guard the door of the house for her. She told him not to let anyone pass him, no matter who they were.
                <br>
                <br>
                Coincidentally, as Ganesh was guarding the door, his father Shiva returned from his journey, and was surprised to see someone standing at the door of his house.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shiva – being quite a quick-tempered god – was enraged that an imposter was preventing him from entering his own house, and proceeded to cut off the head of the young boy. The head flew far into the distance, and the body fell to the floor.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hearing the commotion, Parvati ran to the door and let out a cry as she saw the body of her son lying on the floor. In floods of tears, she told Shiva that he had just killed their only son, and ordered him to revive the boy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Dismayed at what he had done, Shiva agreed to bring their son back to life, and vowed to use the head of the first being he came across to replace the one he’d cut off.
                <br>
                <br>
                As Shiva ordered to travel North and look for a mother facing the other way from her child. In a deep forest only an elephant was seen. Running out of time, they took his sword and swiftly cut off the elephant’s head. Picking up the large and heavy head, they took it back to Shiva and attached it to the body of their son. Giving him life once again, the boy awoke, this time with the head of an elephant.
                <br>
                <br>
                An elephant appeared through the trees and as Shiva remembered his promise, he took his sword and swiftly cut off the elephant’s head. Picking up the large and heavy head, he took it back to his house and attached it to the body of their son. Giving him life once again, the boy awoke, this time with the head of an elephant.
                <br>
                <br>
                Parvati was overjoyed, and although this was perhaps really the face only a mother could love, she loved him as a mother would non-the-less. To further please his wife, and as a mark of respect to his son for the loyalty and bravery it must have taken to guard the door for his mother, Shiva declared that Ganesh would be worshipped first, before any other gods.
