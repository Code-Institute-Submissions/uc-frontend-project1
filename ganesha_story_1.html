                <h4><img src="assets/images/ganesha.jpeg" class="img-circle media-object" height=100 width=100>Lord Ganesha is the eldest son of Lord Shiva and Parvati. Parvati using her powers, created Ganesh from Sandalwood, turmeric, and from the flesh of her own body. She gave him life by sprinkling holy Ganges water over him, and was overjoyed with her new companion.
                <br>
                <br>
                Coincidentally, as Ganesh was guarding the door, his father Shiva returned from his journey, and was surprised to see someone standing at the door of his house.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shiva – being quite a quick-tempered god – was enraged cut off the head of the young boy. The head flew far into the distance, and the body fell to the floor.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hearing the commotion, Parvati ran to the door and let out a cry as she saw the body of her son lying on the floor. In floods of tears, she told Shiva that he had just killed their only son, and ordered him to revive the boy.
                <br>
                <br>
                As Shiva ordered to travel North and look for a mother facing the other way from her child. In a deep forest only an elephant was seen. Running out of time, they took his sword and swiftly cut off the elephant’s head. Picking up the large and heavy head, they took it back to Shiva and attached it to the body of their son. Giving him life once again, the boy awoke, this time with the head of an elephant.
                <br>
                <br>
                An elephant appeared through the trees and as Shiva remembered his promise, he took his sword and swiftly cut off the elephant’s head. Picking up the large and heavy head, he took it back to his house and attached it to the body of their son. Giving him life once again, the boy awoke, this time with the head of an elephant.
